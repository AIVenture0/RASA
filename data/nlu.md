- @IndiGo6E Ok, thanks for your quick reply, but I am hearing my friends being able to use overhead bin as well, because having [7 Kgs](weight) as [laptop](product) [bag](baggage) is very rare. Can I use a smaller size overhead [bag](baggage) compared to earlier practices ?
- @makemytripcare @IndiGo6E Hv flight from BLR-JDH on Sep27, MMT app says that cabin [baggage](baggage) of size only under seat allowed, what is it exactly, can I [carry](baggage) [7 kg](weight) like earlier or no ?
- @IndiGo6E @IndiGo6E: So basically for two people up to [40 kg](weight) checkin [baggage](baggage) is allowed. I just want to make sure so that I don't need to pay extra charges. One more thing are we supposed to keep [laptop](product) [bags](baggage) only below the seats in front of us now!!..
- @IndiGo6E I didn't understand: I have 2 [bags](baggage) for check-in. Together their [weight](weight) is less than [20Kg](weight). In this case, I should pay Rs. 750 extra?
- Hi @IndiGo6E I have questions regarding domestic flights 1. Are the overhead bins not allowed for [baggage](baggage) storage? 2. I have 2 checkin [bags](baggage) total less than [20kgs](weight), is it allowed?  
- @IndiGo6E This is mentioned on my reservation email received from indigo.  Check-in [Baggage](baggage): [20 Kg](weight) per person (One piece only). Extra [10 kg](weight) will be provided in case double seat has been booked. Additional charges will apply for excess [baggage](baggage)
- @IndiGo6E dear Indigo, baggage policy for double seat booking is so confusing even your customer care is unable to provide clear answer if extra [10kg](weight) is allowed in [check-in](baggage). Can you confirm if a passenger is eligible for [10kg](weight) extra [baggage](baggage) on booking double seat?
- @IndiGo6E @PWNeha @IndiGo6E Can I [carry](baggage) a backpack and my acoustic [guitar](product) case in cabin [baggage](baggage)? If the total of both is less than [7 kg](weight)?
- @InterMiles the flight booking database on your site, powered by @EaseMyTrip needs to be updated to reflect correct info. For eg. @IndiGo6E nowadays doesn't allow cabin [baggage](baggage), also they have increased check-in bag limit upto [20kg](weight). Your website shows old and wrong info. Pls check! https://t.co/FGAOQ67ZjF
- @IndiGo6E I see that my cabin-[baggage](baggage) is [0Kg](weight). Can I [carry](baggage) my [laptop](product) bag or I will be charged for it?
- @IndiGo6E Checked [Baggage](baggage) Allowance: [20 kg](weight) per person (One piece only). Extra [10 kg](weight) will be provided in case double seat has been booked. Additional charges will apply for excess baggage Plz tell me max check-in [baggage](weight) allowed.
- @airindiain Hope other airlines should come up with similar thoughts, All domestic airlines should align and allow a min of [23 Kg](weight) for all flights and a cabin [baggage](baggage) so that they align with international standards . Not like @IndiGo6E who don’t allow cabin [bagage](baggage) and levy extra charges.
- Hi @IndiGo6E I will be travelling with 3 [laptops](product), combined [weight](weight) is approx [7 kg](weight). Can I keep those in the cabin [baggage](baggage)? What if the weight is slightly over, not more than [1kg](weight)? Asking for domestic flights
- @IndiGo6E Hey there, I am traveling from Mumbai to Hubli next week. If I prebook [10kgs](weight) additional [baggage](baggage) does it mean I can [carry](baggage) 2 bags totalling [30kg](weight) or 1 [bag](baggage) containing [30kg](weight) in check in [baggage](baggage)??
- @IndiGo6E : Hello Team, QQ- Since Check-in [baggage](baggage) has increased to [20kgs](weight)/person, can I take my bike ([13kgs](weight)) with me without paying extra ? This will be the only [baggage](baggage) I would be [carrying](baggage) alongside a [laptop](product) bag. Thanks

- travelling with my wife and twin babies tomorrow in 6E118. Not able to [select](select) nearby [seats](seat) even though they are free. have [selected](select) auto [seat](seat) [assign](select) for now. 
- Please [assign](select) nearby [seats](seat) or allow to [select](select) nearby [seats](seat). 
- can i [select](select) my own [seats](seat) for free? 
- Why is the option to [select](select) adjacent [seats](seat) not available during web checkin?
- care to explain why you've made every [seat](seat) chargeable to consumers ? 
- How can I change the [seat](seat)-map on your website?
- with infant I am not able to [select](select) 1st row [seats](seat) is there any specific reason?
- How about a family travelling and wanting to sit together? They are bound to pay, right? Else ur auto [seat](seat) [assignment](select) will obviously throw them randomly. Can u please help me web checkin? I dont wish to pay any money for [seat](seat) [selection](select) and want to sit with family.
- window/aisle [seats](seat) in the last rows didn't have to be paid for pre-pandemic. not sure why it has changed now 
- shamelessly charging for adjacent [seats](seat) when I want to sit next to a family member
- I am unable to choose the auto [seat](seat) [selection](select) option and it is not showing. 
- first you charge extra for a [seat](seat) in name of auto [seat](seat) [assignment](select) and then at the time of boarding tell that aircraft is changed hence you cant have [seat](seat) as per your preference
- Why need to pay extra for [seats](seat)? 
- I'm trying to book [seat](seat) online however payment is getting rejected. Could you please assist?
- i m doing web check-in it is asking for money and not letting me [choose](select) the free [seats](seat) 
- Next time you allot [seats](seat) please consider the elderly people.  
- If Webcheck in is mandatory how can you charge for [seats](seat) ? Else designate free [seats](seat) - not a single available [seat](seat) is marked for free ? This is just extra charges. 
- one is forced to pay for a [seat](seat) which is not correct. I have paid now Rs 350 for a [seat](seat) [assignment](select). 
- 3 tickets booked together mother and 2 kids but yet different [seats](seat) offered and had to opt for paid [seats](seat). Felt cheated and did not expect this from Indigo
- I have booked a Indigo flight by paying flexi plus fare but my [seats](seat) didn't get [select](select) due to the app's issue with which I booked. Can you help me out?
- boarding pass is not sent on time (12hrs before) when you check in through auto [seat](seat) [selection](select) and at the time of check-in no free [seats](seat) are available for [selection](select) and when boarding pass is sent it comes with free [seats](seat) [selected](select)...very cheap to do such things.
- [Seats](seat) are subject to availability does not mean middle [seats](seat) are not available at the time of check-in and when auto generated boarding pass come they come with middle [seats](seat) is it not strange or something to investigate internally
- This is with respect to all middle [seats](seat)..so indirectly force customers to buy [seats](seat) at the time of check-in as free [seat](seat) option is not available to [select](select)!
- problem continues. Not allowing to [seat](seat) [select](select) for web check-in today for rescheduled flight. 
- extra [seat](seat) [selection](select) fee of 250 is debeted from my google pay but unable to [select](select) the [seat](seat)
- I am having worst customer experience with your booking, we can understand the rescheduling but why are you asking to pay for the [seats](seat) again, and  why should I settle for options that are not good after already paying much in advance for the [seats](seat) during the booking.
- IndiGo6E Airlines have started charging for [seats](seat) due to mandatory web checkins. This is on top of entire bill an taxes already paid. Most of the times no free [seats](seat) are available an we are forced to pay for [seats](seat). We have no choice
- you can show the vacant [seats](seat) in options which anyway you will allot at the counter and not just give us an option see only the paid [seats](seat). Not fair to charge this way for economy [seats](seat) as it's already a part of the fare + plus you have excess capacity.
- I paid Rs 150 extra for Window [seat](seat) while booking but allotted with middle [seat](seat). What about my extra money and your promises....
- I tried to do a webcheckin since that is mandatory but could not find free [seats](seat). Do you expect my parents to be sitting on far separate [seats](seat) bcz only middle [seat](seat) was free nd now there are none.
- you are rather putting a scam by charging us for [seats](seat).. There is no measure of maintaining social distancing. There should at least be a gap of 1 [seat](seat). But No! All [seats](seat) one after the other and we are being charged for it
- On 29th there is flight of my brother. By 2pm and connecting flight by 6pm but still [seat](seat) [selection](select) link is not open for me.
- We have scheduled flight  on 29th August Saturday 4:30p.m. for 3 passengers including 2.5 years kid . During web check-in, there is no any row available with three continue [seats](seat).when asked from customer care ,they are asking for charge again to [allocate](select) continue [seat](seat)
- While booking tickets I had [selected](select) [seat](seat) by paying 150 Rs extra but while web check in my [selected](select) [seat](seat) chosen showed 'already booked' and I was [assigned](select) a different [seat](seat). Please help. Can i get a refund.?
- @Cleartrip Dear team please make it ASAP as only 2 [seats](seat) are left, please call me to book the [seat](seat) My mobile number is 00971508516536 @Cleartrip @IndiGo6E
- @IndiGo6E Please [assign](select) the [seats](seat) for [BFF9NV](PNR) for boarding pass
- @IndiGo6E please help in chkin pnr [BFF9NV](PNR). Cant [select](select) [seat](seat)
- @IndiGo6E  not able to check in [BFF9NV](PNR) pnr no [seat](seat) is [selected](select) please help
- @IndiGo6E @MoCA_GoI  My PNR no is [NMJKQQ](PNR). There are 6 passengers of which 2 Senior citizen with wheel chair and 2 kids below 10. Your auto [assign](select) has allocated everyone a separate [seat](seat) and senior citizen middle [seat](seat) for which they have to wear PPE Kit. Can you help.
- Flying by 6E2405 want to ask @IndiGo6E what is the fun in buying the first row when with 174 load on the flight u still fill ur middle [seat](seat) in first row with non purchasers of [seats](seat) ...frequent flyers shud think twice before booking
- @IndiGo6E why you are cheating your customers with pre [assigned](select) [seats](seat) at the time of so called mandatory web check in. I have flight tomorrow and not going to pay this at all.
- @DGCAIndia @IndiGo6E please note that in Flight no. 6E5055, covid related social distancing norms not being followed. [Seat](seat) no. 23C called a flight purser to request the person [seated](seat) at the window to wear his mask but no one is bothered about these things.
- @IndiGo6E Middle [seat](seat) person is given ppe gown. Rest all face shield and mask
- @IndiGo6E If they are running full, are there any measures in place to avoid any harm if any like distancing while [seating](seat)
- @IndiGo6E Y don't u ask the pax to remain [seated](seat).... strictly...seems u just fullfil the PA formalities...
- @IndiGo6E Hi Team, do you keep the middle [seat](seat) vacancy in all domestic flights m travelling with parens and my infant from pune to jaipur. Plz reply
- @IndiGo6E Team, i want to fly alone ,why i should book more than 2 [seats](seat) ?
- @indigo6e conveniently doesn't send boarding passes on time (mind you boarding passes are necessary to enter airports these days) and then 4) Makes you [select](select) a [seat](seat) for a heavy price (almost nil Free [seats](seat) available)
- @IndiGo6E how I can secure a [seat](seat) in chartered  flight going to Saudi before September 28
- I didnt realize how much Ive missed flying until I strapped myself in that window [seat](seat) on @IndiGo6E
- I think @IndiGo6E  loves me very much... Always get window [seat](seat) for free
- @IndiGo6E your ways of extracting money from Customers these days are really unique. So after I have paid for my ticket , to do webcheckin I need to pay for [seats](seat)!! And if I dont go with paid options you dont provide me boarding pass?? Ticket doesnt come with a [seat](seat)!! Wow
- Why should I choose auto [assign](select) option and [select](select) any [seat](seat) when I have paid premium amount for Corporate Booking ? @IndiGo6E offers complimentary extra legroom [seats](seat) under Corporate Booking.
- @IndiGo6E It is sad to separate ppl in economy class by getting money in picture.. the [seat](seat) [selection](select) logic needs scrutiny
- @IndiGo6E I wonder why no one gets window or aisle [seat](seat) via that random logic. Logic is not random. It cannot be. I booked 4 [seats](seat) and got 4 center [seat](seat). Check the empty [seats](seat).
- @IndiGo6E - booked two tickets with 2 passengers each and auto [seat](seat) [selection](select) [assigned](select) 4 center [seats](seat) in different rows. flight shows around 150 empty [seats](seat) with charges from 1000 to 150. 2 passengers are senior citizens. 
- Why are you charging all [seats](seat) during web check-in process? You're charging high price for legroom [seats](seat) for premium Corporate booking. UNETHICAL. 
- @IndiGo6E Flight number 6E 6248,I wish to know if Row number 13 is RECLINABLE and has extra leg space? Also mention any other [seat](seat) with same features asap,i need to book after knowing it
- @IndiGo6E it's so sad that indigo doesn't allow you to choose the free [seats](seat) while web check in. Why have that option then!
- @IndiGo6E Hi, I was able to do web check-in, but the auto [allocation](select) has allotted side by side [seats](seat), B and C, hope the airline still follows social distancing norms , or , look into the auto [allocation](select) algorithm. Doesn't seem to be updated for CoVID protocols.
- @IndiGo6E a booking made more than a month ago after paying extra for front row aisle [seat](seat), flight is now canceled. Yes, it is not in your control. But what is in your control is to treat a customer with a little more sensitivity
- @IndiGo6E If you want to maintain social distancing, then please keep middle [seat](seat) empty and not travel full capacity. The "lighter" @IndiGo6E keeps the airline, the better it is. There is absolutely no logic in what you are saying.
- Good going @IndiGo6E , every [seat](seat) apart from middle is chargeable which everyone knows that customers wont prefer during #COVID19 Understand ur financial stress on airlines but this just feels like #profiteering and definitely nt customer friendly. 
- Another disappointing experience with @IndiGo6E today 2 passengers have been [assigned](select) the same [seat](seat), creating inconvenience How careless can an airline be considering the current #Pandemic situation
- I do not understand why are u charging extra for [seats](seat) while web check in whereas other airlines are giving free meals and [seats](seat) u should learn from @IndiGo6E  No more bookings from u got to know you scammers, ur customer service is worst #GoairScam#Fraud
- Also, in front section  i could see middle [seats](seat) are availble, whereas at back middle [seats](seat) are not available/ occupied? is it not mandatory to leave middle [seats](seat)?
- @IndiGo6E [LPDFTX](PNR) pnr delhi to bangalore i dnt want to pay extra charge for [seat](seat) [selection](select)
- @IndiGo6E Thanks. But is web check-in not mandatory? If I have to do web check in, I have to [select](select) [seat](seat) also. So will airport check-in counter be able to change the [seats](seat) [assigned](select) to me during web check-in?
- @IndiGo6E Travelling with my child and my wife. Can not [select](select) the middle [seat](seat) such that all three of us are [seated](seat) together in a row while doing web check in. Can the [seats](seat) be changed at the airport counter?
- You randomly changed my [seats](seat) which I had carefully [selected](select) for my wife and me, considering social distancing norms, so we got same row!
- @IndiGo6E is the money given at time of ticket booking not enough get [seat](seat) together with travel partner? Not asking for xl or any special [seat](seat) just a [seat](seat) together. I m doing a web check and to my surprise all [seats](seat) a paid. Dont be such sellouts shame on you.
- @IndiGo6E Y money is being charged for [seat](seat) [selection](select) n also r u flying with full [seat](seat) occupancy in current pandemic
- @IndiGo6E if web check-in is mandatory, Why and I being forced to pay for [seats](seat) for web check-in?? Don't I have the right to check in at the airport counter ? Is this how you try to make money? By taking advantage of consumers in time of need ?
